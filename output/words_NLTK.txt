alices adventures in wonderland lewis carroll the millennium fulcrum edition 29 chapter i down the rabbithole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversation
so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her
there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear
oh dear
i shall be late
when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge
in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again
the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well
either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next
first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs
she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it
well
thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
how brave theyll all think me at home
why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house
which was very likely true
down down down
would the fall never come to an end
i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time
she said aloud
i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth
let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to
alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say
presently she began again
i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth
how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward
the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know
please maam is this new zealand or australia
and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling through the air
do you think you could manage it
and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking
no itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere
down down down
there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again
dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think
dinah was the cat
i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime
dinah my dear
i wish you were down here with me
there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know
but do cats eat bats i wonder
and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats
do cats eat bats
and sometimes do bats eat cats
for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it
she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat
when suddenly thump
thump
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it
there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting
she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof
there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again
suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas
either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them
however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted
alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head though the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders
oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope
i think i could if i only know how to begin
for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters
it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry
no ill look first she said and see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later
however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off
what a curious feeling
said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope
and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going though the little door into that lovely garden
first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle
i wonder what i should be like then
and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice
when she got to the door she found he had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried
come theres no use in crying like that
said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute
she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people
but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people
why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants
well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens
she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way
which way
holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake
chapter ii the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser
cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was
goodbye feet
for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off
oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears
im sure _i_ shant be able
i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go
let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas
and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet
and how odd the directions will look
alices right foot esq
hearthrug near the fender with alices love
oh dear what nonsense im talking
just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door
poor alice
it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again
you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way
stop this moment i tell you
but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall
after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh
the duchess the duchess
oh
wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting
alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go
alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear
how queer everything is today
and yesterday things went on just as usual
i wonder if ive been changed in the night
let me think was i the same when i got up this morning
i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i
ah thats the great puzzle
and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them
im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh
she knows such a very little
besides shes she and im i andoh dear how puzzling it all is
ill try if i know all the things i used to know
let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear
i shall never get to twenty at that rate
however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography
london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno thats all wrong im certain
i must have been changed for mabel
ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale
how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh
ever so many lessons to learn
no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here
itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
i shall only look up and say who am i then
tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody elsebut oh dear
cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down
i am so very tired of being all alone here
as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking
how can i have done that
she thought
i must be growing small again
she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether
that was a narrow escape
said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden
and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas
the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never
and i declare its too bad that it is
as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash
she was up to her chin in salt water
he first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself
alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station
however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high
i wish i hadnt cried so much
said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
however everything is queer today
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse
everything is so outoftheway down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying
so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool
i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse
alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof a mouseto a mousea mouseo mouse
the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing
perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror
for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened
so she began again ou est ma chatte
which was the first sentence in her french lessonbook
the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright
oh i beg your pardon
cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings
i quite forgot you didnt like cats
not like cats
cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice
would you like cats if you were me
well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it
and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not
we indeed
cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail
as if i would talk on such a subject
our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things
dont let me hear the name again
i wont indeed
said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation
are youare you fondofof dogs
the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you
a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair
and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds
he says it kills all the rats andoh dear
cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again
for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went
so she called softly after it mouse dear
do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them
when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures
alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore
chapter iii a caucusrace and a long tale they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable
the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life
indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said
at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me
ill soon make you dry enough
they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle
alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon
ahem
said the mouse with an important air are you all ready
this is the driest thing i know
silence all round if you please
william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh
said the lory with a shiver
i beg your pardon
said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak
not i
said the lory hastily
i thought you did said the mouse
i proceed
edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable found what
said the duck
found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means
i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck its generally a frog or a worm
the question is what did the archbishop find
the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown
williams conduct at first was moderate
but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear
it continued turning to alice as it spoke
as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to dry me at all
in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english
said the eaglet
i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either
and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly
what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace
what is a caucusrace
said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything
why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it
and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it
first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there
there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over
however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over
and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence
at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes
but who is to give the prizes
quite a chorus of voices asked
why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes
prizes
alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes
there was exactly one apiece all round
but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse
of course the dodo replied very gravely
what else have you got in your pocket
he went on turning to alice
only a thimble said alice sadly
hand it over here said the dodo
then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered
alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could
the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back
however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more
you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hatec and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again
mine is a long and a sad tale
said the mouse turning to alice and sighing
it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad
and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you
come ill take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning ive nothing to do
said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath
ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death
you are not attending
said the mouse to alice severely
what are you thinking of
i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think
i had not
cried the mouse sharply and very angrily
a knot
said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her
oh do let me help to undo it
i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away
you insult me by talking such nonsense
i didnt mean it
pleaded poor alice
but youre so easily offended you know
the mouse only growled in reply
please come back and finish your story
alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do
but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker
what a pity it wouldnt stay
sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear
let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper
hold your tongue ma
said the young crab a little snappishly
youre enough to try the patience of an oyster
i wish i had our dinah here i know i do
said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular
shed soon fetch it back
and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question
said the lory
alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinahs our cat
and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think
and oh i wish you could see her after the birds
why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it
this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party
some of the birds hurried off at once one the old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat
and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears
its high time you were all in bed
on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone
i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah
she said to herself in a melancholy tone
nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world
oh my dear dinah
i wonder if i shall ever see you any more
and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited
in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story
chapter iv the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess
the duchess
oh my dear paws
oh my fur and whiskers
shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets
where can i have dropped them i wonder
alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely
very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here
run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan
quick now
and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made
he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran
how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am
but id better take him his fan and glovesthat is if i can find them
as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it
she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves
how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit
i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next
and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice
come here directly and get ready for your walk
coming in a minute nurse
but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out
only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that
by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass
there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips
i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does
i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken
she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much
alas
it was too late to wish that
she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens
what will become of me
luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy
it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits
i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life
i do wonder what can have happened to me
when i used to read fairytales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one
there ought to be a book written about me that there ought
and when i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here
but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now
thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman but thenalways to have lessons to learn
oh i shouldnt like that
oh you foolish alice
she answered herself
how can you learn lessons in here
why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooks
and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen
mary ann
mary ann
said the voice
fetch me my gloves this moment
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs
alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure
alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window
that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air
she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sort
next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat
pat
where are you
and then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here
digging for apples yer honour
digging for apples indeed
said the rabbit angrily
here
come and help me out of this
sounds of more broken glass
now tell me pat whats that in the window
sure its an arm yer honour
he pronounced it arrum
an arm you goose
who ever saw one that size
why it fills the whole window
sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that
well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away
there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all
do as i tell you you coward
and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air
this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass
what a number of cucumberframes there must be
thought alice
i wonder what theyll do next
as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could
im sure i dont want to stay in here any longer
she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voice all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherbill
fetch it here ladhere put em up at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh
theyll do well enough dont be particular here bill
catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmind that loose slateoh its coming down
heads below
a loud crashnow who did thatit was bill i fancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant
you do itthat i wont thenbills to go downhere bill
the master says youre to go down the chimney
oh
so bills got to come down the chimney has he
said alice to herself
shy they seem to put everything upon bill
i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little
she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next
the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill
then the rabbits voice alongcatch him you by the hedge
then silence and then another confusion of voiceshold up his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it old fellow
what happened to you
tell us all about it
last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye im better nowbut im a deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocket
so you did old fellow
said the others
we must burn the house down
said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do
ill set dinah at you
there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next
if they had any sense theyd take the roof off
after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with
a barrowful of what
thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again
which produced another dead silence
alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head
if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose
so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly
as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood
the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
i think that will be the best plan
it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
poor little thing
said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut
this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance
and yet what a dear little puppy it was
said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id only been the right size to do it
oh dear
id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again
let me seehow is it to be managed
i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what
the great question certainly was what
alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances
there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it
she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else
chapter v advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice
who are you
said the caterpillar
this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation
alice replied rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then
what do you mean by that
said the caterpillar sternly
explain yourself
i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you see
i dont see said the caterpillar
im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing
it isnt said the caterpillar
well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you
not a bit said the caterpillar
well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to me
you
said the caterpillar contemptuously
who are you
which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first
why
said the caterpillar
here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away
come back
the caterpillar called after her
ive something important to say
this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again
keep your temper said the caterpillar
is that all
said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could
no said the caterpillar
alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing
for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you
im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together
cant remember what things
said the caterpillar
well ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different
alice replied in a very melancholy voice
repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar
alice folded her hands and began you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right
in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again
you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that
in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple
you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it
in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life
you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever
i have answered three questions and that is enough said his father dont give yourself airs
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff
be off or ill kick you down stairs
that is not said right said the caterpillar
not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered
it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes
the caterpillar was the first to speak
what size do you want to be
it asked
oh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know
i dont know said the caterpillar
alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper
are you content now
said the caterpillar
well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be
it is a very good height indeed
said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high
but im not used to it
pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone
and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended
youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again
this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself
then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter
one side of what
the other side of what
thought alice to herself
of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight
alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question
however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
and now which is which
she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
come my heads free at last
said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
what can all that green stuff be
said alice
and where have my shoulders got to
and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you
she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent
she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings
serpent
screamed the pigeon
im not a serpent
said alice indignantly
let me alone
serpent i say again
repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them
i havent the least idea what youre talking about said alice
ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents
theres no pleasing them
alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished
as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day
why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks
im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning
and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
ugh serpent
but im not a serpent i tell you
said alice
im aim a well
what are you
said the pigeon
i can see youre trying to invent something
iim a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day
a likely story indeed
said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt
ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that
no no
youre a serpent and theres no use denying it
i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg
i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know
i dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say
this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent
it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont like them raw
well be off then
said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest
alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it
after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual
come theres half my plan done now
how puzzling all these changes are
im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another
however ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be done i wonder
as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high
whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits
so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high
chapter vi pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles
it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads
she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen
the fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess
an invitation from the queen to play croquet
the frogfootman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen
an invitation for the duchess to play croquet
then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together
alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked
theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons
first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you
and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces
please then said alice how am i to get in
there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us
for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know
he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil
but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head
but at any rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in
she repeated aloud
i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him
or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened
how am i to get in
asked alice again in a louder tone
are you to get in at all
said the footman
thats the first question you know
it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so
its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue
its enough to drive one crazy
the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations
i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days
but what am i to do
said alice
anything you like said the footman and began whistling
oh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic
and she opened the door and went in
the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup
theres certainly too much pepper in that soup
alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing
there was certainly too much of it in the air
even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause
the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear
please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that
its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why
pig
she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grin
they all can said the duchess and most of em do
i dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation
you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact
alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation
while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes
the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
oh please mind what youre doing
cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror
oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off
if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does
which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge
just think of what work it would make with the day and night
you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head
alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twentyfour hours i think or is it twelve
i oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures
and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases
chorus
in which the cook and the baby joined wow
wow
wow
while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases
chorus
wow
wow
wow
here
you may nurse it a bit if you like
the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke
i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room
the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed her
alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought alice
the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it
as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air
if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind
she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time
dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself
the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it
there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all
but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears
no there were no tears
if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you
mind now
the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence
alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home
when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm
this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood
if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think
and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off
the cat only grinned when it saw alice
it looked good natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider
come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on
would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat
i dont much care where said alice
then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat
so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation
oh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough
alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question
what sort of people live about here
in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare
visit either you like theyre both mad
but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked
oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here
im mad
youre mad
how do you know im mad
said alice
you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here
alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that youre mad
to begin with said the cat a dogs not mad
you grant that
i suppose so said alice
well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased
now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im angry
therefore im mad
i call it purring not growling said alice
call it what you like said the cat
do you play croquet with the queen today
i should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited yet
youll see me there said the cat and vanished
alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening
while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again
bythebye what became of the baby
said the cat
id nearly forgotten to ask
it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way
i thought it would said the cat and vanished again
alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live
ive seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it was in march
as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree
did you say pig or fig
said the cat
i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy
all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone
well
ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat
its the most curious thing i ever say in my life
she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur
it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all
i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead
chapter vii a mad teaparty there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the talking over its head
very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind
the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room
no room
they cried out when they saw alice coming
theres plenty of room
said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table
have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone
alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea
i dont see any wine she remarked
there isnt any said the march hare
then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily
it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare
i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three
your hair wants cutting said the hatter
he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech
you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude
the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writingdesk
come we shall have some fun now
thought alice
im glad theyve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that she added aloud
do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it
said the march hare
exactly so said alice
then you should say what you mean the march hare went on
i do alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean what i saythats the same thing you know
not the same thing a bit
said the hatter
you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see
you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like
you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe
it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks which wasnt much
the hatter was the first to break the silence
what day of the month is it
he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear
alice considered a little and then said the fourth
two days wrong
sighed the hatter
i told you butter wouldnt suit the works
he added looking angrily at the march hare
it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied
yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife
the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know
alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
what a funny watch
she remarked
it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is
why should it
muttered the hatter
does your watch tell you what year it is
of course not alice replied very readily but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time together
which is just the case with mine said the hatter
alice felt dreadfully puzzled
the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english
i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could
the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose
the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself
have you guessed the riddle yet
the hatter said turning to alice again
no i give it up alice replied whats the answer
i havent the slightest idea said the hatter
nor i said the march hare
alice sighed wearily
i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers
if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it
its him
i dont know what you mean said alice
of course you dont
the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously
i dare say you never even spoke to time
perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music
ah
that accounts for it said the hatter
he wont stand beating
now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock
for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling
halfpast one time for dinner
i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper
that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but theni shouldnt be hungry for it you know
not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked
is that the way you manage
alice asked
the hatter shook his head mournfully
not i
he replied
we quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat
how i wonder what youre at
you know the song perhaps
ive heard something like it said alice
it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way up above the world you fly like a teatray in the sky
twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop
well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time
off with his head
how dreadfully savage
exclaimed alice
and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask
its always six oclock now
a bright idea came into alices head
is that the reason so many teathings are put out here
she asked
yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles
then you keep moving round i suppose
said alice
exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up
but what happens when you come to the beginning again
alice ventured to ask
suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning
im getting tired of this
i vote the young lady tells us a story
im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal
then the dormouse shall
they both cried
wake up dormouse
and they pinched it on both sides at once
the dormouse slowly opened his eyes
i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying
tell us a story
said the march hare
yes please do
pleaded alice
and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done
once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on
said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking
they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two
they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well
take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly
ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant take more
you mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take more than nothing
nobody asked your opinion said alice
whos making personal remarks now
the hatter asked triumphantly
alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question
why did they live at the bottom of a well
the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treaclewell
theres no such thing
alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh
sh
and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself
no please go on
alice said very humbly i wont interrupt again
i dare say there may be one
one indeed
said the dormouse indignantly
however he consented to go on
and so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw you know what did they draw
said alice quite forgetting her promise
treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time
i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all move one place on
he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare
the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate
alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i dont understand
where did they draw the treacle from
you can draw water out of a waterwell said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh stupid
but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark
of course they were said the dormouse well in
this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it
they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an m why with an m
said alice
why not
said the march hare
alice was silent
the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness
really now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont think then you shouldnt talk said the hatter
this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot
at any rate ill never go there again
said alice as she picked her way through the wood
its the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in all my life
just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it
thats very curious
she thought
but everythings curious today
i think i may as well go in at once
and in she went
once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table
now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden
then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocked till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains
chapter viii the queens croquetground a large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red
alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five
dont go splashing paint over me like that
i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow
on which seven looked up and said thats right five
always lay the blame on others
youd better not talk
said five
i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded
what for
said the one who had spoken first
thats none of your business two
said seven
yes it is his business
said five and ill tell himit was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions
seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low
would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses
five and seven said nothing but looked at two
two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know
so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen
the queen
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces
there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen
first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did
after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts
next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her
then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts
alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember every having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it
so she stood still where she was and waited
when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this
she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply
idiot
said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on whats your name child
my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after all
i neednt be afraid of them
and who are these
said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children
how should i know
said alice surprised at her own courage
its no business of mine
the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head
off nonsense
said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent
the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child
the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over
the knave did so very carefully with one foot
get up
said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else
leave off that
screamed the queen
you make me giddy
and then turning to the rosetree she went on what have you been doing here
may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying i see
said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses
off with their heads
and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection
you shant be beheaded
said alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near
the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others
are their heads off
shouted the queen
their heads are gone if it please your majesty
the soldiers shouted in reply
thats right
shouted the queen
can you play croquet
the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her
yes
shouted alice
come on then
roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next
itsits a very fine day
said a timid voice at her side
she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face
very said alice wheres the duchess
hush
hush
said the rabbit in a low hurried tone
he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under sentence of execution
what for
said alice
did you say what a pity
the rabbit asked
no i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pity
i said what for
she boxed the queens ears the rabbit began
alice gave a little scream of laughter
oh hush
the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone
the queen will hear you
you see she came rather late and the queen said get to your places
shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began
alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches
the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed
the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head
or off with her head
about once in a minute
alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me
theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive
she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to
how are you getting on
said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with
alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded
its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them
in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her
the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared
i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming
how do you like the queen
said the cat in a low voice
not at all said alice shes so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game
the queen smiled and passed on
who are you talking to
said the king going up to alice and looking at the cats head with great curiosity
its a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it
i dont like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes
id rather not the cat remarked
dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that
he got behind alice as he spoke
a cat may look at a king said alice
ive read that in some book but i dont remember where
well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear
i wish you would have this cat removed
the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small
off with his head
she said without even looking round
ill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off
alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion
she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not
so she went in search of her hedgehog
the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree
by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend
when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable
the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life
the kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense
the queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round
it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious
alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about it
shes in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here
and the executioner went off like an arrow
the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the dutchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game
chapter ix the mock turtles story you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing
said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off together
alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen
when im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all
soup does very well withoutmaybe its always pepper that makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered
i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk
i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit
perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark
tut tut child
said the duchess
everythings got a moral if only you can find it
and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke
alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin
however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could
the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little
tis so said the duchess and the moral of that isoh tis love tis love that makes the world go round
somebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own business
ah well
it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves
how fond she is of finding morals in things
alice thought to herself
i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo
shall i try the experiment
he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried
very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite
and the moral of that isbirds of a feather flock together
only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked
right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things
its a mineral i think said alice
of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said theres a large mustardmine near here
and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of yours
oh i know
exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark its a vegetable
it doesnt look like one but it is
i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that isbe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise
i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it
thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone
pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice
oh dont talk about trouble
said the duchess
i make you a present of everything ive said as yet
a cheap sort of present
thought alice
im glad they dont give birthday presents like that
but she did not venture to say it out loud
thinking again
the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin
ive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried
just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble
alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm
a fine day your majesty
the duchess began in a low weak voice
now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time
take your choice
the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment
lets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground
the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives
all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head
or off with her head
those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution
then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet
no said alice
i dont even know what a mock turtle is
its the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen
i never saw one or heard of one said alice
come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned
come thats a good thing
she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered
they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun
if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture
up lazy thing
said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history
i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon
alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited
the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled
what fun
said the gryphon half to itself half to alice
what is the fun
said alice
why she said the gryphon
its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know
come on
everybody says come on
here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break
she pitied him deeply
what is his sorrow
she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know
come on
so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing
this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do
ill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished
so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes
alice thought to herself i dont see how he can even finish if he doesnt begin
but she waited patiently
once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle
these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh
from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle
alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing
when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea
the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one
alice asked
we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth
at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow
dont be all day about it
and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it i never said i didnt
interrupted alice
you did said the mock turtle
hold your tongue
added the gryphon before alice could speak again
the mock turtle went on
we had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day ive been to a dayschool too said alice you neednt be so proud as all that
with extras
asked the mock turtle a little anxiously
yes said alice we learned french and music
and washing
said the mock turtle
certainly not
said alice indignantly
ah
then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief
now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washingextra
you couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea
i couldnt afford to learn it
said the mock turtle with a sigh
i only took the regular course
what was that
inquired alice
reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision
i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say
what is it
the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise
what
never heard of uglifying
it exclaimed
you know what to beautify is i suppose
yes said alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanything prettier
well then the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton
alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn
well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils
what was that like
said alice
well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said im too stiff
and the gryphon never learnt it
hadnt time said the gryphon i went to the classics master though
he was an old crab he was
i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say
so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws
and how many hours a day did you do lessons
said alice in a hurry to change the subject
ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on
what a curious plan
exclaimed alice
thats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day
this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark
then the eleventh day must have been a holiday
of course it was said the mock turtle
and how did you manage on the twelfth
alice went on eagerly
thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now
chapter x the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes
he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice
same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back
at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is
no indeed said alice
what sort of a dance is it
why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the seashore two lines
cried the mock turtle
seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon
you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner
cried the gryphon
of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon
then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the the lobsters
shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air
as far out to sea as you can swim after them
screamed the gryphon
turn a somersault in the sea
cried the mock turtle capering wildly about
back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice
it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly
would you like to see a little of it
said the mock turtle
very much indeed said alice
come lets try the first figure
said the mock turtle to the gryphon
we can do without lobsters you know
which shall sing
oh you sing said the gryphon
ive forgotten the words
so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly will you walk a little faster
said a whiting to a snail
theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance
you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea
but the snail replied too far too far
and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance
would not could not would not could not would not join the dance
would not could not would not could not could not join the dance
what matters it how far we go
his scaly friend replied
there is another shore you know upon the other side
the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance
thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting
oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle theyyouve seen them of course
yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily
i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like
i believe so alice replied thoughtfully
they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs
youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea
but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyestell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon
the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance
so they got thrown out to sea
so they had to fall a long way
so they got their tails fast in their mouths
so they couldnt get them out again
thats all
thank you said alice its very interesting
i never knew so much about a whiting before
i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon
do you know why its called a whiting
i never thought about it said alice
why
it does the boots and shoes
the gryphon replied very solemnly
alice was thoroughly puzzled
does the boots and shoes
she repeated in a wondering tone
why what are your shoes done with
said the gryphon
i mean what makes them so shiny
alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer
theyre done with blacking i believe
boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting
now you know
and what are they made of
alice asked in a tone of great curiosity
soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that
if id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song id have said to the porpoise keep back please we dont want you with us
they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
wouldnt it really
said alice in a tone of great surprise
of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise
dont you mean purpose
said alice
i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone
and the gryphon added come lets hear some of your adventures
i could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then
explain all that said the mock turtle
no no
the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time
so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit
she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on
her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very curious
its all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon
it all came different
the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully
i should like to hear her try and repeat something now
tell her to begin
he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice
stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon
how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons
thought alice i might as well be at school at once
however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair
as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes
later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound
thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon
well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense
alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again
i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle
she cant explain it said the gryphon hastily
go on with the next verse
but about his toes
the mock turtle persisted
how could he turn them out with his nose you know
its the first position in dancing
alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject
go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden
alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie later editions continued as follows the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat
when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on
its by far the most confusing thing i ever heard
yes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so
shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille
the gryphon went on
or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song
oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm
no accounting for tastes
sing her turtle soup will you old fellow
the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen
who for such dainties would not stoop
soup of the evening beautiful soup
soup of the evening beautiful soup
beauootiful soooop
beauootiful soooop
soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup
beautiful soup
who cares for fish game or any other dish
who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful soup
pennyworth only of beautiful soup
beauootiful soooop
beauootiful soooop
soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup
chorus again
cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning
was heard in the distance
come on
cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song
what trial is it
alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on
and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup
chapter xi who stole the tarts
the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other
in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments
but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time
alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there
thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig
the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming
and thats the jurybox thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors
she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all
however jurymen would have done just as well
the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
what are they doing
alice whispered to the gryphon
they cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun
theyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial
stupid things
alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court
and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking
alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things
on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him
a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over
thought alice
one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked
this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away
she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate
herald read the accusation
said the king
on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away
consider your verdict the king said to the jury
not yet not yet
the rabbit hastily interrupted
theres a great deal to come before that
call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness
the first witness was the hatter
he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other
i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for
you ought to have finished said the king
when did you begin
the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arminarm with the dormouse
fourteenth of march i think it was he said
fifteenth said the march hare
sixteenth added the dormouse
write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
take off your hat the king said to the hatter
it isnt mine said the hatter
stolen
the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact
i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation ive none of my own
im a hatter
here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted
give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you executed on the spot
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter
just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her
i wish you wouldnt squeeze so
said the dormouse who was sitting next to her
i can hardly breathe
i cant help it said alice very meekly im growing
youve no right to grow here said the dormouse
dont talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know youre growing too
yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion
and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court
all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert
on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off
give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you executed whether youre nervous or not
im a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea the twinkling of the what
said the king
it began with the tea the hatter replied
of course twinkling begins with a t
said the king sharply
do you take me for a dunce
go on
im a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after thatonly the march hare said i didnt
the march hare interrupted in a great hurry
you did
said the hatter
i deny it
said the march hare
he denies it said the king leave out that part
well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep
after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread andbutter but what did the dormouse say
one of the jury asked
that i cant remember said the hatter
you must remember remarked the king or ill have you executed
the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and went down on one knee
im a poor man your majesty he began
youre a very poor speaker said the king
here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done
they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it
im glad ive seen that done thought alice
ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now
if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the king
i cant go no lower said the hatter im on the floor as it is
then you may sit down the king replied
here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed
come that finished the guineapigs
thought alice
now we shall get on better
id rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers
you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on
and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door
call the next witness
said the king
the next witness was the duchesss cook
she carried the pepperbox in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once
give your evidence said the king
shant said the cook
the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must crossexamine this witness
well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of
pepper mostly said the cook
treacle said a sleepy voice behind her
collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out
behead that dormouse
turn that dormouse out of court
suppress him
pinch him
off with his whiskers
for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared
never mind
said the king with an air of great relief
call the next witness
and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must crossexamine the next witness
it quite makes my forehead ache
alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself
imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice
chapter xii alices evidence here
cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before
oh i beg your pardon
she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die
the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said do
alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move
she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other
as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court
what do you know about this business
the king said to alice
nothing said alice
nothing whatever
persisted the king
nothing whatever said alice
thats very important the king said turning to the jury
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke
unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone importantunimportant unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word sounded best
some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant
alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself
at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his notebook cackled out silence
and read out from his book rule fortytwo
all persons more than a mile high to leave the court
everybody looked at alice
im not a mile high said alice
you are said the king
nearly two miles high added the queen
well i shant go at any rate said alice besides thats not a regular rule you invented it just now
its the oldest rule in the book said the king
then it ought to be number one said alice
the king turned pale and shut his notebook hastily
consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice
theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up
whats in it
said the queen
i havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody
it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know
who is it directed to
said one of the jurymen
it isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the outside
he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isnt a letter after all its a set of verses
are they in the prisoners handwriting
asked another of they jurymen
no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it
the jury all looked puzzled
he must have imitated somebody elses hand said the king
the jury all brightened up again
please your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they cant prove i did theres no name signed at the end
if you didnt sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse
you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man
there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day
that proves his guilt said the queen
it proves nothing of the sort
said alice
why you dont even know what theyre about
read them said the king
the white rabbit put on his spectacles
where shall i begin please your majesty
he asked
begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop
these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim
he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you
i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before
if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were
my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it
dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me
thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence
_i_ dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it
the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper
if theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any
and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all
said i could not swim you cant swim can you
he added turning to the knave
the knave shook his head sadly
do i look like it
he said
which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard
all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true thats the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice
why there they are
said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table
nothing can be clearer than that
then againbefore she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think
he said to the queen
never
said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke
the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted
then the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile
there was a dead silence
its a pun
the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day
no no
said the queen
sentence firstverdict afterwards
stuff and nonsense
said alice loudly
the idea of having the sentence first
hold your tongue
said the queen turning purple
i wont
said alice
off with her head
the queen shouted at the top of her voice
nobody moved
who cares for you
said alice she had grown to her full size by this time
youre nothing but a pack of cards
at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face
wake up alice dear
said her sister why what a long sleep youve had
oh ive had such a curious dream
said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late
so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been
but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sisters dream
the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried bythe frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle
so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all thy other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs
lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days
